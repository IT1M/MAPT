NAME : MAPT (MAIS ANALYSIS PROJECT TEST)


Perfect! Your application is now running on http://localhost:3001 (port 3000 was already in use).

The issue was that your database wasn't set up properly. I've fixed it by:

Creating the medical_inventory database
Updating your .env file with the correct PostgreSQL credentials (using your macOS username)
Pushing the Prisma schema to create all tables
Seeding the database with test data
You can now log in with these credentials:

Email: admin@saudimais.com
Password: Password123!
Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser and you should see the login page.


npm run db:studio          
 npm run dev
 git add .         
  git commit -m "first commit"  
  git push -u origin main     

  ## Useful Commands



### 2. Run Migrations

Create the database schema:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

This will:
- Create all tables defined in `schema.prisma`
- Apply any pending migrations
- Generate the Prisma Client

### 3. Seed Database

Populate with test data:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```bash
# Generate Prisma Client (after schema changes)
npm run db:generate

# Push schema changes without migrations (development)
npm run db:push

# Create a new migration
npm run db:migrate

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio

# Seed database with test data
npm run db:seed

# Verify database connection
npm run db:verify
