# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating all previously built pages into a cohesive application with professional navigation, sidebar, routing, and user experience enhancements. The system will provide a unified interface that connects Dashboard, Data Entry, Data Log, Analytics, Reports & Backup, Audit, and Settings pages with role-based access control, responsive design, and comprehensive user experience features.

## Glossary

- **Navigation System**: The collection of UI components (sidebar, header, breadcrumbs) that enable users to move between different pages of the application
- **Sidebar**: A persistent vertical navigation panel displaying menu items with icons and labels
- **Main Layout**: The root layout component that wraps all pages and provides consistent structure
- **Route Guard**: Middleware that checks user authentication and authorization before allowing access to protected routes
- **Breadcrumbs**: A navigation aid showing the user's current location in the application hierarchy
- **User Session**: The authenticated state of a user including their role and permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A security mechanism that restricts system access based on user roles
- **Loading State**: Visual feedback displayed while data is being fetched or processed
- **Empty State**: UI displayed when no data is available for a particular view
- **Toast Notification**: A temporary message that appears to provide feedback about an action
