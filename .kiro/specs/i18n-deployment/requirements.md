# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive bilingual support (English and Arabic) using next-intl, configuring environment variables for different deployment environments, optimizing the application for production, and establishing a deployment pipeline to Vercel with proper monitoring and error handling. The system must provide seamless language switching, proper RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Arabic, secure environment variable management, and a robust deployment process.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Saudi Mais Inventory Management Application
- **next-intl**: The internationalization library for Next.js applications
- **RTL**: Right-to-Left text direction used in Arabic language
- **LTR**: Left-to-Right text direction used in English language
- **Locale**: A language and region combination (e.g., 'en' for English, 'ar' for Arabic)
- **Translation Key**: A unique identifier used to retrieve localized text
- **Vercel**: The cloud platform for deploying Next.js applications
- **Environment Variable**: Configuration values that differ between development and production
- **Middleware**: Server-side code that runs before request completion
- **ISR**: Incremental Static Regeneration for optimized page rendering
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between English and Arabic languages, so that I can use the application in my preferred language

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the System loads, THE System SHALL detect the user's preferred locale from the URL path, Accept-Language header, or default to English
2. THE System SHALL provide a language switcher component in the navigation header that displays the current language with appropriate visual indicators
3. WHEN a user selects a different language, THE System SHALL switch all interface text to the selected language without requiring a page reload
4. THE System SHALL persist the user's language preference in a cookie for subsequent visits
5. THE System SHALL maintain the current page URL path when switching languages (e.g., /en/dashboard becomes /ar/dashboard)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the application in Arabic, I want the interface to display in right-to-left layout, so that the content is naturally readable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the locale is set to Arabic, THE System SHALL apply RTL text direction to all text content
2. WHEN the locale is set to Arabic, THE System SHALL mirror the layout by positioning navigation elements on the right side
3. WHEN the locale is set to Arabic, THE System SHALL flip directional icons horizontally to match RTL reading flow
4. WHILE displaying Arabic content, THE System SHALL maintain LTR direction for numerical values and dates
5. THE System SHALL set the HTML dir attribute to "rtl" when Arabic locale is active and "ltr" when English locale is active

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all user-facing text to be translatable, so that the application supports both English and Arabic consistently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL store all translatable text in structured JSON files located at /messages/en.json and /messages/ar.json
2. THE System SHALL organize translation keys using nested namespaces (e.g., "common", "auth", "navigation", "dataEntry")
3. THE System SHALL provide translations for all pages including data entry, data log, analytics, settings, audit, and backup sections
4. THE System SHALL format dates using locale-specific formatting (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY for English, DD/MM/YYYY for Arabic)
5. THE System SHALL format numbers using locale-specific separators and maintain proper currency formatting for SAR

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate translation completeness, so that no missing translations cause runtime errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide a validation script that compares translation keys between en.json and ar.json files
2. WHEN translation keys are missing in either language file, THE System SHALL report the missing keys with their locations
3. THE System SHALL provide TypeScript type definitions for translation keys to enable compile-time validation
4. WHEN a translation key is not found at runtime, THE System SHALL display the key name as fallback text
5. THE System SHALL log warnings for missing translations in development mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment variables properly configured for different environments, so that the application runs securely in development and production

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL define separate environment variable configurations for development (.env.local) and production (.env.production)
2. THE System SHALL validate all required environment variables on application startup using a schema validation library
3. WHEN required environment variables are missing or invalid, THE System SHALL prevent application startup and display clear error messages
4. THE System SHALL encrypt sensitive environment variables (database credentials, API keys, secrets) in the production environment
5. THE System SHALL document all environment variables with descriptions and example values in .env.example

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application deployed to Vercel with automatic deployments, so that updates are delivered quickly and reliably

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL connect the Git repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on commits to the main branch
2. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE System SHALL automatically trigger a build and deployment process
3. THE System SHALL run Prisma migrations as part of the build process to ensure database schema is up to date
4. THE System SHALL configure proper security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP) in the Vercel configuration
5. WHEN deployment fails, THE System SHALL provide detailed error logs and maintain the previous working deployment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application optimized for production performance, so that users experience fast load times and smooth interactions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL use Next.js Image Optimization for all images to serve properly sized and formatted images
2. THE System SHALL implement code splitting to load only necessary JavaScript for each page
3. THE System SHALL enable compression (gzip or brotli) for all text-based assets
4. THE System SHALL configure database connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently
5. THE System SHALL achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 90 or higher for key pages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and error tracking configured, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL enable Vercel Analytics to track page views, performance metrics, and Core Web Vitals
2. THE System SHALL log all server-side errors with sufficient context (user ID, request path, timestamp, error stack)
3. THE System SHALL configure log levels appropriately (debug for development, error for production)
4. WHEN critical errors occur in production, THE System SHALL send alerts to designated administrators
5. THE System SHALL provide a dashboard or interface to view error logs and performance metrics

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a CI/CD pipeline configured, so that code quality is maintained and deployments are automated

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL run TypeScript type checking on every pull request before allowing merge
2. THE System SHALL run ESLint code quality checks on every pull request before allowing merge
3. THE System SHALL execute the build process on every pull request to catch build errors early
4. WHEN all checks pass, THE System SHALL automatically deploy to production on merge to main branch
5. THE System SHALL provide rollback capability to revert to the previous deployment if issues are detected

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper backup and rollback procedures, so that I can recover from deployment failures or data issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide instant rollback capability through the Vercel dashboard to revert to any previous deployment
2. THE System SHALL maintain database migration history to enable manual rollback of schema changes if needed
3. THE System SHALL document the rollback procedure with step-by-step instructions for common scenarios
4. THE System SHALL create a maintenance mode page that can be activated during critical updates or issues
5. THE System SHALL test the rollback procedure in a staging environment before production deployment
