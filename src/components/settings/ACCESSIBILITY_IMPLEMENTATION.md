# Settings Interface Accessibility Implementation

This document describes the accessibility features implemented in the settings interface to ensure WCAG AA compliance and provide an inclusive user experience.

## Overview

The settings interface has been enhanced with comprehensive accessibility features including:
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Screen reader support with ARIA labels and live regions
- High contrast theme support
- Touch target size compliance (44x44px minimum)
- Text scaling support up to 200%

## Implemented Features

### 1. Responsive Design

#### Mobile Adaptations
- **Navigation**: Converts from sidebar to collapsible drawer on mobile (<768px)
- **Tables**: Switches to card layout on mobile for better readability
- **Forms**: Full-width inputs with sticky save buttons
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet 44x44px minimum size

#### Swipe Gestures
- Swipe right: Open navigation sidebar
- Swipe left: Close navigation sidebar
- Implemented in `SettingsLayout.tsx` using touch events

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
Implemented in `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`:
- **Ctrl/Cmd + K**: Focus search input
- **Ctrl/Cmd + S**: Save current settings (where applicable)
- **Esc**: Close modals or sidebar
- **Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within lists and menus

#### Focus Management
- Visible focus indicators with 2px outline
- Focus trap in modals to prevent focus escape
- Skip links to jump to main content
- Logical tab order throughout the interface

### 3. Screen Reader Support

#### ARIA Labels and Roles
All components include proper ARIA attributes:
- `role="navigation"` for navigation areas
- `role="main"` for main content
- `role="search"` for search inputs
- `role="status"` for status messages
- `role="alert"` for error messages
- `aria-label` for all interactive elements
- `aria-describedby` for form field descriptions
- `aria-invalid` for form validation states

#### ARIA Live Regions
- Global live region for announcements (`aria-live="polite"`)
- Section change announcements
- Form save status announcements
- Search result announcements

Implementation in `accessibility-settings.ts`:
```typescript
announceToScreenReader('Navigated to Profile Settings')
```

### 4. Form Accessibility

#### Input Fields
- All inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- Required fields marked with `aria-required="true"`
- Error states use `aria-invalid="true"`
- Error messages linked with `aria-describedby`
- Minimum height of 44px for touch targets

#### Validation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Error messages announced to screen readers
- Visual and programmatic error indicators

#### Auto-save
- Status indicators with `role="status"`
- Announcements for save states (saving, saved, error)

### 5. Table Accessibility

#### Desktop View
- Proper table semantics (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`)
- Column headers with `scope="col"`
- Sortable columns with ARIA labels
- Pagination with `role="navigation"`

#### Mobile View
- Converts to card layout for better mobile experience
- Each card has `role="article"`
- Maintains all interactive functionality
- Touch-friendly buttons (44x44px minimum)

### 6. High Contrast Support

Implemented in `accessibility.css`:
- Detects `prefers-contrast: high` media query
- Increases border widths to 2px
- Enhances text contrast
- Thicker focus indicators (3px)

### 7. Reduced Motion Support

Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` preference:
- Disables animations and transitions
- Instant state changes instead of animated
- Scroll behavior set to auto

### 8. Color Contrast

All text meets WCAG AA standards:
- Normal text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text: 3:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements: 3:1 contrast ratio

Utility classes in `accessibility.css`:
- `.contrast-aa`: Ensures AA compliance
- `.contrast-aaa`: Ensures AAA compliance

### 9. Text Scaling

Supports up to 200% text scaling:
- Responsive font sizes using rem units
- No horizontal scrolling at 200% zoom
- Flexible layouts that adapt to text size
- Font size preferences stored in user settings
