## How to Create Screenshots

1. **Take Screenshots**
   - Navigate to your app in a browser
   - Use browser dev tools to set viewport size
   - Take screenshots of key pages

2. **Optimize Images**
   - Use PNG or JPEG format
   - Compress images to reduce file size
   - Recommended tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim

3. **Naming Convention**
